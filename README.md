# Project Title
The name of this project is *transparent restaurant*. The main goal of the project is to build a web page for a restaurant that promotes honesty. The restaurant lets users know that every ingredient has a different quality and lets the users select ingredients by themselves. They needed a developer for that so I worked on the task :)
